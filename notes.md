# Notes

Stage -> Commit -> Push
(working, saving) -> (officially save to git) -> (publish to remote repo, github)

Commands in Terminal:
git - use it first, tells computer that you'll be entering git commands after
(git) init - initialize as a git repository
(git) status - check status of directory you're in
(git) add file.type - add specified file to git tracking (this is staging)
(git) add . - add all untracked files in current directory
(git) commit -m "message" - commit changes (save), best practice to add '-m' tag with
    descriptive message about what you've changed
